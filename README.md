# Oliver Telford

I am an information technology professional with a BEng (Hons) in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Loughborough University.

My interest in Data Science first emerged while working as an IT Network & Security Specialist. During this period I came to see the importance of Big Data as a tool for developing new technologies. In addition to my exposure to large data processing, during my time as a professional poker player I studied the application of Game Theory to the process of decision making, logic and the science of probability. My studies of Poker taught me how to make data-driven decisions evaluating risk levels at each stage of the decision making process to determine if a given strategy will prove successful long term. Data science has proven to be the next logical step in the development of my skills and past experiences, allowing me to help organizations become more data driven in their approach to decision making.

My current goal is to join an organization where I can continue to develop this knowledge and work collaboratively as part of a team.
